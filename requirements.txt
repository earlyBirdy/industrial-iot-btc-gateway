# Minimal dependencies (standard library used where possible)
# For real deployments, you may add:
# requests          # If you call external APIs for anchoring
# python-bitcoinlib # If you speak to bitcoind directly and need tx utils
# cryptography      # If you integrate real key material, TLS client certs, etc.
